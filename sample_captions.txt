success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts
believe you can and you're halfway there
the only way to do great work is to love what you do
don't watch the clock; do what it does. keep going
the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams
it does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop
everything you've ever wanted is on the other side of fear
hardships often prepare ordinary people for an extraordinary destiny
your limitationâ€”it's only your imagination
great things never come from comfort zones
dream it. wish it. do it
don't stop when you're tired. stop when you're done
wake up with determination. go to bed with satisfaction
do something today that your future self will thank you for
little things make big days
it's going to be hard, but hard does not mean impossible
don't wait for opportunity. create it
sometimes we're tested not to show our weaknesses, but to discover our strengths
the key to success is to focus on goals, not obstacles
dream bigger. do bigger
